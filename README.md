## Reminders
The master branch is protected, you must first create a new branch to add a feature or make changes, and then do a pull-request that will be reviewed by at least one other member of the team. It must in addition build successfully on TravisCI and pass the requirements of Code Climate before being allowed to merge.


### App requirements
- Split app model: must use cloud-based services (e.g., Google maps, Firebase).
- Use of (at least one) phone sensor (GPS, camera, mic, etc).
- User support: The app must support the concept of users, and provide means of authenticating users. 
- Database access: make use of Android's wrapper around SQLite for local database access.
- Automated test suite: minimum level of 80% code coverage

> "A beautiful piece of code, even if perfect, that lacks test cases will get a minimal score on the correctness and maintainability aspects of the grading rubric, so please test thoroughly."
